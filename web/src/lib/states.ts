/**
 * Indian states and union territories, by the two-letter code this system uses.
 *
 * The code is what decides the GST split: same state as the warehouse means
 * CGST + SGST, different means IGST. A free-text field here would eventually
 * produce "Mh" and "MH" as two different states and quietly tax an order the
 * wrong way, so every place a state is chosen picks from this list.
 *
 * Ordered by name so the picker reads alphabetically.
